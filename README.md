[Inspiration]
We wanted to create a fun and engaging way to experience memes with an element of randomness and excitement. Slot machines are addictive, and memes are universally loved—so why not combine them? The idea was to introduce a gamified meme experience where users can "spin" to get different levels of humor, making each roll feel rewarding.

[What it does]
MemeSlot is a digital slot machine where users spin to receive a random meme. The rarity of the meme is determined by how funny it is—common memes are mildly amusing, while the rarest ones are top-tier internet gold. Users can keep spinning to try their luck at landing the rarest and funniest memes.

[How we built it]
We developed MemeSlot using Next.JS for the front end and ASP.NET for handling the backend function and hosting the images. The meme database is categorized based on a funniness scale, ensuring a fair but exciting distribution. A slot machine animation enhances the experience, making each spin dynamic and engaging.

[Challenges we ran into]
Defining a fair but rewarding rarity system for memes
Finding a way to categorize memes based on funniness in a way that feels natural
Implementing smooth slot machine animations and making the experience feel engaging
Integrating sound effects to improve the feel and excitement of the roll.
